# Infoscreen slides

This repository contains HTML slides for infoscreens around our
university.  Public information only (obviously).

This can be previewed on Github pages, but the Github Pages should
probably not be used for infoscreen playlists since it will make a lot
of unnecessary traffic.

Instead, these should be manually copied/deployed to a local
webserver.  This is currently not automatic but should be made
automatic someday.
